# Collect the yellow blocks and Win!

## About

This was my first coding project I ever completed. It was completed around January of 2018. This project was an awesome first step into the world of computer programming, and being able to reflect on this 2 years later is a truly valuable thing to do. 

## Usage

Before anything, head over to the [Unity Website](https://unity.com/) and get yourself set up with an account. Download their Unity Hub and install the version best recommended for your machine. If you're interested in following through the tutorial which I completed, [Check out the Playlist on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_fAidYRGzs) Unity hub offers many more tutorials which are just as interesting and valuable, the "Roll the Ball" demo in my opinion is one of the most beginner friendly ones. The video game demo is built using core Unity game packages, and some minor customary scripting. Unity used C##, but anyone familiar with the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming will be able to grasp what is being done, and why it's being done.

# Conclusion
If you follow the tutorial linked above, you'll have your own "Roll the Ball" demo to share with friends. In the future, I'd love to revisit this project and perhaps add a timer and other features. If I could make this game feel like a "Time Attack" styled game, with better and more original art styles, that would be awesome. Thanks for checking this out!
